# SelectText-Recogniser
This simple program helps you copy text when common selection is impossible.

You just need to select the piece of screen which contains the text you need to copy.
(Using the ALT key twice to choose two opposite diagonal points to create a rectangle - selection)
Then this program will recognise text on the selected image and paste the result to your clipboard.

In this project core components are OpenCV and Tesseract. 
```diff
- !!!Tesseract has to be installed on your computer to run this code!!!

I'll probably add comments soon, but now it's just a raw working code.
